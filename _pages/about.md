About me 
======
Ciao! 

I am Michael Neri and I earned my Laurea (B.Sc.) in Information Engineering from the University of Padua in 2019, followed by a Laurea Magistrale (M.Sc.) in ICT for Internet & Multimedia from the same university in 2021. 

Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. (XXXVII cycle) in Applied Electronics at Roma Tre University, where I am affiliated with the Department of Industrial, Electronic, and Mechanical Engineering.

During my Ph.D., in 2023, I visited Tampere University of Technology in Finland as a visiting Ph.D. student where I conducted research under the guidance of Prof. Virtanen.

My research interests are in the field of Artificial Intelligence techniques applied to sound solving tasks such as Sound Event Detection, Acoustic Scene Classification, and Speaker Distance Estimation. In general, my works on audio processing revolves around the research context of the DCASE (Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scene and Events). In addition, I am also interested in effectively evaluating the quality of multimedia (point clouds, light fields, etc..) by using objective metrics.
