About me 
======
Ciao!

I am Michael Neri, who graduated in 2019 with a Laurea (B.Sc.) in Information Engineering and further in 2021 with a Laurea Magistrale (M.Sc.) in ICT for Internet & Multimedia at the University of Padua.

Now, I am attending the Ph.D. course in Applied Electronics at Roma Tre University.

In 2023, being a Ph.D. student, I visited Tampere University of Technology, Finland, as a visiting Ph.D. student, where I conducted some research under the supervision of Prof. Virtanen.

My research interests lie in the domain of Artificial Intelligence techniques applied to Sound Solving tasks: Sound Event Detection, Acoustic Scene Classification, and Speaker Distance Estimation. Most of my works that are related to audio processing are within the DCASE (Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scene and Events) research context. At the same time, I am also interested in the effective quality assessment of multimedia (point clouds, light fields, etcâ€¦) using objective metrics.
